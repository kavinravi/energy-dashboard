Between April 2nd and May 12th 2025, actions by the Trump administration on tariffs significantly altered the effective costs of goods imported from China, including battery systems, cells, and components. For battery systems, cells, and components, there are also section 301 tariffs (7.5% on lithium-ion batteries until January 1st, 2026, 25% on battery parts, materials, and lithium-ion batteries after January 1st) as well as a baseline 3.4% ad valorem tariff. Leveraging CEA's proprietary methodologies and expertise, subscribers gain a competitive edge, ensuring well-informed decision-making in the rapidly evolving ESS industry.",
