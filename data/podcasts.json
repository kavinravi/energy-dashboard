    "title": "Can AI revolutionize EPC?",
    "description": "Big construction projects in the U.S. are notoriously unpredictable, often finishing over budget and behind schedule. Part of the problem is the inherent complexity of these kinds of projects, like data centers and first-of-a-kind plants. But there\u2019s another problem: the companies that actually build these projects \u2014 called EPC firms for engineering, procurement, and construction \u2014 often lack strong incentives to control costs or deliver on time.\u00a0\n\nThat\u2019s the thesis behind Unlimited Industries, a new startup focused on using AI to develop multiple project designs upfront and reduce project risks. So what would it take to actually cut costs and shorten construction timelines?\n\nIn this episode, Shayle talks to Alex Modon, co-founder and CEO of Unlimited Industries. The company recently announced a $12 million fundraise as it emerged from stealth.

Latitude media covering the new frontier of the energy transition. I'm Shale Khan, and this is Catalyst. As a third-party contractor, your incentive is really, we only make money when the project costs more and takes longer. So, yeah, high level what's broken is the incentive structure. Coming up, is there a better way using modern technology to build big capital projects? Surging electricity demand is testing the limits of the grid, but Energy Hub is helping utilities stay ahead. Energy Hub's platform transforms millions of connected devices, like thermostats, EVs, batteries, and more into flexible energy resources. That means more reliability, lower costs, and cleaner power without new infrastructure. Energy Hub partners with over 120 utilities nationwide to build virtual power plants that scale. Learn how the industry's leading flexibility provider is shaping the future of the grid. Visit Energy Hub.com. Clean energy is under attack, and it's more important than ever to understand why projects fail and how to get them back on track. The Center Left Think Tank third way surveyed over 200 clean energy professionals to answer that exact question. Their newest study identifies the top non-cost barriers to getting projects over the finish line, from permitting challenges to nimbism.

I lead the early stage venture strategy at Energy Impact Partners. Welcome. All right. So here's a cycle that I have seen play out many, many times. Developer X of Project Y wants to go build a big new project. And somewhere in the development process, they engage in EPC, EPC being an engineering procurement construction firm. There are many of them. Many of them are very, very large, and they're kind of ubiquitous if you're going to build a big capital project. They engage the EPC, and then there's a fairly painful process from there on where it's slower than they want it to be. They have to go through multiple cycles of iteration. There's value engineering. The cost comes in higher than they expect. And then at the end of the day, there are a bunch of change orders anyway. And there are cost overruns. There are time overruns. It's not necessarily the fault of the EPC. Lots of things can happen in the world. But the process of actually getting big projects constructed is notoriously hard. And some folks have been wondering whether there is a way to leverage modern technology, AI included, to do it better. Certainly that is the opinion of Alex Modan, who is our guest today. Alex is the CEO and co-founder of Unlimited Industries, which is a startup that reasonably unstelfed to basically be a modern EPC. They're starting to start from scratch to build a company that will do engineering procurement and construction with new technology with a different business model to try to get projects built faster, more on budget, potentially cheaper. It's an interesting question. And it applies to everything from data centers to power generation projects, battery storage projects, new chemical plants, anything that we might build that's a big capital project. So it's relevant to basically everything else that we talk about here. Anyway, here's Alex. Alex, welcome. Hello. Thanks for having me. Thanks for being here. Let's talk about EPC, engineering procurement construction. You founded a company based on the premise that it could be done better. So I want to start with what's wrong with it today as you've observed EPCs and how they work. Like fundamentally, what is the problem that you see? Yeah. Well, it might be first contextualizing like the what is EPC and where's the play in the value chain. So to start this, let's just imagine we're going to build, I don't know, let's just say a data center project. So if we want to go build a data center project as an owner of a project or a developer for project, the first thing that we do is we kind of find the land and we contract that and we start to figure out what permits we need. We figure out a power we need to buy. And then you typically go find an off taker or some sort of tenant for that actual data center project or again, whatever the product is that comes out of the facility. And the last big contract that you're trying to do is go find the third party that's going to design and build the thing. EPC engineering procurement construction is basically the vertically integrated or all three of the kind of design, manage the supply chain, actually manage the build of the project, all three of those in one contractor. And for all intents and purposes, they are the people who design and build the thing, that EPC piece. And so I think when I got into it, I was actually really excited the first time we went to go work with an EPC thinking that there's going to be all these different kind of disciplines and institutional knowledge under one single. I think the biggest thing that's challenged with the industry today is that the incentives between the developer, the person who actually wants to build a thing better, faster, cheaper, or some sort of metric like that versus the third party. The incentives are so fundamentally misaligned because of how these contracts get produced. And so you either have, the vast majority of these contracts have some element of cost plus where we'll give some sort of guidance about how much the project's going to cost. But as a third party contractor, your incentive is really, we only make money when the project costs more and takes longer. Or there's sometimes these contracts that run on a fixed firm basis where that third party will actually say, hey, we'll build it for this much. But they define the contract so tightly that inevitably what happens is when you learn something through the design process or when things change, which inevitably they always do, you get issued these massive change orders. And that's at that point, that's where that third party EPC typically makes all their margin just because you're already working together and you can't really easily leave. So yeah, high level what's broken is it's the incentive structure. The incentives between the third party or the actual developer who wants to build better faster, cheaper and the third party who's in control of making all the decisions about what gets designed and what actually gets built. If I'm being charitable to EPCs and I asked the question of like, why is it cost plus typically or fixed firm but where change orders are the norm, I would imagine in part it is because there's one, there's this like time lag, right? Like they're signing the contract on day one, but they're actually procuring the commodity materials six months later, a year later, 18 months later, whatever it might be. Those prices are volatile. They would have to hedge them every single time if they weren't going to do that. And not to mention labor availability at labor costs and all this other stuff. So is it because they just can't wear that kind of a risk, the like time risk or is your experience that there's a different reason why it ended up being cost plus or fixed firm with all sorts of change orders? No, I mean, definitely just steelman. It's because it's ultra complex to build these projects. There is hundreds of people that will be evolved in how the thing gets designed. That manages the entire supply chain to get it built and then manages all of the like boots on the ground of the project that's actually doing the building. So there is tons of complexity. And the reason that these contracts are structured in this inherently flexible way is because it's really hard to know at front how much exactly is the thing at a cost. So yeah, it certainly is like evolved this way because when you think about these projects and I mean, the small version of these are like $100 million. The more normal version of these is many hundreds of millions and then the bigger ones are in certainly in the media billions of costs. So because you have all that risk, the contracts effectively are this big like risk mitigation strategy. And that the easy way for the EPC not to take any risk is just to say we're going to get a margin on top of what it costs us to build a thing. But the problem is that there's no motivation then to make the thing cost less. If anything, there's a motivation the other way to make a cost more. Yeah, you mentioned there's a lot of people and a lot of uncertainty. I mean, I guess one thing, one way I think about it is that there's a spectrum of different types of projects on one end of the spectrum is a thing that looks the same every time you build it more or less. I mean, maybe a version of this would be, I don't know, utility scale battery projects or utility scale solar or something like that where like, you know, we've built hundreds of them. They generally look the same wherever you go. You would imagine that on those types of projects, it would be pretty well known. Maybe there's some commodity risk. Maybe there's some labor risk, but like broadly speaking, the designs are going to be similar and the experience is high. And then in the other end of the spectrum, there's like a first of a kind thing that's never been built before. And they're obviously your error bars on the cost and the time, the labor and all that is going to be highest. Do you? And then there's a bunch of stuff in between. I imagine data centers are in between actually, because in some ways they look the same. There's like a powered shell. The shell is a building. But then inside the data center, right? Like there's all sorts of innovation. Like this one liquid cool. Is this one using which in video chips is it using? How is it designed? There's so much innovation in that space that it's changing all the time. Which also changes the facility too, right? Like it's these changes trickle out for sure. Right. So I guess as you think about this, like the incentive structure being misaligned, do you view it as being more misaligned on the, I guess, relatively speaking, easier stuff to build? Because there you should be able to have high level certainty on what the cost should be a priori. Or is it more misaligned on the esoteric stuff because the error bars are even higher. And so the risk aversion of the EPC leads them to like way over price, for example. Yeah. Yeah. Like the contingencies or the greedlessness of this like cost misalignment is certainly true with the more custom the project gets. So the first of the kinds are a great example of that. Or like you even mentioned data centers that are shifting in their requirements, of course, have more and more of this baked in. It's basically just correlated to risk. Like how much risk is there in this? Solar has less and less risk as we deploy more and more the exact same way. Same thing with utility storage. But I do think that like where you see, so you definitely get. Missile line contracts or misaligned incentives, which kind of balloon costs. And that is the kind of status quo for how you contract these things anyways. But the other other thing that kind of falls into this is how projects broadly are approached. And so if you think about how we build products, like we have a metric for it, right? We say, hey, we're going to make this widget. It's going to come out of a factory. We'll have some sort of cost per widget metric. And that allows us to kind of approach these projects with this continuous improvement type approach and drive costs down. That's like our learning rate, I think arguably like that's why solar has fallen so aggressively is because we keep kind of making or at least I should say the module costs, which is even different than this is maybe a side tangent, but it's like different than the actual installer costs. Yeah. Well, it's actually the problem with solar is that the module costs have fallen much faster than the install costs have, right? We haven't solved it on the construction and all the other commodity materials and stuff. Yeah. And that's because all progress happens with this like, you know, highly iterative process and this could continue improvement process that we get out of manufacturing a thing. But when we move into projects world, everything's a snowflake. It's like, you know, everything's N of one. Even a project that we're building, you know, we built lots of refineries. That next refinery that we build is still an N of one project. Because it's approached in that way, you don't really get any sort of benefits of learning through that process. And, you know, by definition, each project is going to be unique. It's a different piece of land. But yeah, and again, maybe this is a tangent, but that's like another big problem in the industry is everything's done from scratch. So even if you're going to go design a new, you know, a slightly different data center or solar project or something else, that sort of every tweak or change that you make effectively reduces the entire redesign of the process. And so yes, there's some stuff that gets lifted. But the overall amount of work that happens is not the kind of delta of the change. It is like a significant rehaul of work. And it keeps, it just keeps us from like learning and iterating to improve how something gets designed, not just in terms of saving engineering costs, which is actually a pretty small piece of the cost anyways, but actually like kind of having a better design that improves the overall cost or performance of the facility. I guess one thing I wonder is, okay, so let's take EPC, right? Like in engineering procurement and construction, just taking out the simplest base layer of what the work entails. Let's just say you could dramatically improve because what you're describing is like the learning, I think, I guess maybe is on all three, but predominantly on like engineering, can you design this thing so that it's fast and easy to design is definitely going to work up front? My guess is that in most of these big capital projects, the E out of EPC is the smallest slice of the pie in terms of total costs. And like the bulk of the cost probably comes from a combination of procurement, the actual physical materials, much of which are going to be like steel and cement and aluminum and, you know, commodities that have prices that vary. And then construction, which is sort of a function. It's an outcropping of how the engineering occurs, but certainly is also just driven by construction process and labor and so on. So as you think about, like, where is there an opportunity to deliver cost reduction and also cost certainty? Like how much of it is the E versus the P versus the C? Yeah, totally. Okay. So those are two separate things, right? Like, so let's say cost certainty versus like an overall reduction cost. On the certainty side, everything, it's really kind of planned out or teased out in the engineering portion. Right. And so generally, again, life cycle of these projects are, you know, you start with some conceptual design, you understand maybe plus or minus 50%, how much the thing is going to cost. Then for the most part, you dig into this like front end engineering design and you will get to totally changes per project, but say you get to like plus or minus 10% of cost. And that gives you enough confidence to go to a lender, an actual bank and say, hey, let's underwrite this project. We think you're going to get the IRR you need. And then we move forward. But in the vast majority of projects, when you go to final investment decision and you have plus or minus 10% estimates, you're only maybe 30% of the way through your engineering. 70% you still have to go do. And you just, it doesn't make sense to do it upfront because it takes a lot of time and it costs a lot of money. And it's a lot easier to finance that with the actual lenders money rather than the development capital. So the certainty that you have going into a project before you actually take the money from the bank to go build it is actually pretty low. Like there's so much more work to go do. And you just don't do it because there's a high marginal cost at the engineering. So one way that you really reduce all the risk, if you will, or all this like uncertainty from how the project is going to work is if you could instead just take these projects further through the design process so that by the time you're, you know, you're doing your, your earthworks or you're moving some sort of ground, you're actually 100% done. You have your issued for construction package, which doesn't happen today. And so there's, there's that big piece on like, how do you remove uncertainty? How do you remove costs? I mean, yeah, you're totally right. The engineering cost is anywhere from like three to 10% or 15% of the project costs. So it's not a huge lever in itself. But if you think about the way these projects are designed today, because again, such a high marginal cost to engineering, what you end up doing is you only really design something one pass through. There's no sort of iteration. There's no optimization of design. And that leads you to a spot where you kind of make early decisions, you freeze those design decisions, you kind of do the next stage gate of design, of your design process. And you eventually get stuck in these like very like low local optimums rather than ever understanding what the global optimum of that design processes. So, yeah, I mean, like I can get more into how we approach this problem, but the there's huge gains and opportunities to use the E to rapidly reduce the P and the C. The grid wasn't built for what's coming next. Electricity demand is surging from data centers to EVs and utilities. They need reliable, affordable solutions that don't require building expensive new infrastructure. Energy Hub helps by turning everyday devices like smart thermostats, EVs, home batteries and more into virtual power plants. These flexible energy resources respond in near real time to grid needs, balancing supply and demand. Plus, they can be deployed in under a year and at 40 to 60% lower cost than traditional infrastructure. That means more reliability, lower costs, cleaner energy. You can't get much better than that. And that is why over 120 utilities across North America trust Energy Hub to manage more than 1.8 million devices. Learn more at energyhub.com or click the link in the show notes. Do you ever wonder why it takes so long to get clean energy projects up and running? Do you have permitting reform on the brain? Are you NEPA reform curious? The new paste study from Third Way pinpoints the non-cost barriers that stand in the way of clean energy deployment and keep new solar and transmission projects in limbo. They surveyed more than 200 industry professionals to understand what's slowing down deployment and offer practical solutions on how to fix it.

AI data centers are being told that it will take years to get grid power. They can't afford to wait, so they're turning to on-site power solutions like Bloom Energy. Bloom can deliver clean ultra reliable, affordable power that's always on in as little as 90 days. Bloom's fuel cells offer data centers other important advantages. They adapt to volatile AI workloads. They have an ultra low emissions profile that usually allows for faster and simpler permitting and their cost effective too. That's why leaders from across the industry trust Bloom to power their data centers. Ready to power your AI future? Visit bloomenergy.com to learn more. Okay, let's talk about how to use technology, which is I think what you're alluding to here. This is an area where my suspicion is generally it's not the first category of AI adoption, or at least it hasn't been historically. Where do you see the biggest opportunity? Where are the step function improvements that one can achieve by leveraging modern technology, BDAI or something else? Yeah. We have built a lot of technology to help accelerate that pre-construction phase. So this is basically the E and lots of the procurement management side of things. We have a software and an AI native version of this that helps accelerate the chemical design, mechanical, electrical, civil, structural controls. And in doing that, we basically are building a platform that allows us to remove that risk, but at a very, very low marginal cost. So that helps you accelerate through the design process, not just saving time, but exploring a much wider search base and getting to much greater levels of definition before you actually have to freeze designs. And that has a big impact to the previous point, right? It's just like removing uncertainty, reducing costs through optimization. Can you go a level deeper on that? What does that actually mean to reduce uncertainty using software? Like, what are you actually doing? Yeah. If you start a project today at zero, it's completely uncertain, right? And as you start specifying, we're defining the bringing definition to that project, which is the process of engineering it. You start to see more, you start to remove risk, right? You say, hey, we can actually size a pump that will solve that, moving the fluid from point A to point B. Or actually, we can design a tank like this to hold this amount of volume. And once you start providing that level of definition, you remove a lot of the ambiguity, but there's still tons and tons that goes into the thousands of documents that you'll generate to design a plant fully. So this is what we kind of built. Like it is a platform that our engineers use. I think the important distinction here is this is not like a software technology that we sell. It's like we use this as an internal tool, ourself. So our engineers have this kind of AI platform that has all of their data in one place, all the kind of requirements about the project, all of the potential vendors that could be used. And they use it to basically accelerate that design process really significantly. We haven't like redefined how you're engineering these projects. We've kind of augmented it, like significantly augmented the people that are doing that work, so that they're able to just with the same amount of time and capital, they're able to define way more and provide way more kind of engineering definition, as well as like time to optimize those designs. So you can remove kind of suboptimal design. Can you articulate a little bit like what is distinct about this from the, you know, that EPCs have been using engineering software that is super mature for a long time. Maybe that's the problem, but like what's distinct about what you just described from what you could just get off the shelf to design a project? Most of the software in this industry really hasn't changed much in the last like maybe 20 years. And I again kind of always come back to the incentive structure. If there's no real incentive structure for an EPC to want better software, it's the same reason your law firm doesn't necessarily want like AI software to help them accelerate and reduce their billables. So the way these software work now is that there is a bunch of kind of distributed software solutions or maybe decentralized solutions. So you'll have a CAD tool that you use to actually like do the designs. You'll do almost all your kind of rough engineering or hand calcs in Excel. You'll use dedicated simulation software for some sort of fluid design or structural analysis whatever that might be. And then you use another tool to like review those PDFs with a tool to put red lines on them and go through design cycles and then push to drafters and then other tools to manage how do you reach out to your vendors. And anyways, there's all these different solutions that software solutions that you're using in order to kind of quote unquote like do engineering. And what we built kind of from day one was just a modern version of the software. So we put all those different disparate tools into one underlying platform. And we gave modern software to them, which is like, you know, automatically doing version control and collaboration and everything that you would expect out of just like a modern tool. And what that allows us to do is not just kind of have much more streamlined workflows, but it allows us to kind of build AI in as a core primitive to the solution. So now sometimes our engineers will do some sort of work manually within one of our softwares. But often they will dedicate a kind of delegate a task to an AI that knows how to use all those tools in our software so that it can do that design task and then surface that back to the engineer who delegated it. So it's at least in significant part, it's like integration of a bunch of what otherwise are kind of disparate workflows to allow for faster iteration and more automated iteration. Like you do a change somewhere in one piece of software right now, you'd have to go to another piece of software, like make the change in that software, see how it changes the other thing, do that over and over again. So it's like, it's like, build everything into a single comprehensive suite, basically. Yeah, totally. There's like one underlying data model. There's not, you know, the same piece of data that shows up in 10 different softwares. And that's really helpful, not just again for streamlining your own workflows, but it's so that an AI can do it. And it doesn't have to like manage all these different tools and interfaces that, you know, the same information is repeated, but out of date or edited by the wrong person who didn't have permission or something else. When you say AI in this context, what do you, what do you mean? Like is it LLM type AI where you're like, I want to be able to, in my single pane of glass, be able to ask, you know, like, what would happen if I changed all the screws and this entire project from X to Y or something like that? Like is it LLM AI? Is it, what is the AI? Yeah, it's also a version of what you're describing that's like enterprise software for sure, but doesn't, and like there's a big data component to it, but it's not inherently AI. Yeah, no, it's like an exact use case, the one that you gave that, you know, you would do. So, so we'll like record all our meetings. And that meeting you're having with a handful of different disciplines of engineers or people understand the commercial, the agreement, and what that'll trigger through that recording is like a bunch of tasks for AI to go do. And it's, you just basically mentioned a trade there, right? It's like, what if we had, I don't know, one type of material over another type of material, one type of conveyance over another type of conveyance for this project, this material? RAI will go explore that different design path. And that's a trade that you would give to an engineer and you say, go spend a week, like assess the trade off between using, you know, belt conveyance or pneumatic conveyance for some sort of material handling problem, and then tell me back what do we feel like is the right kind of total cost of ownership trade. And then it'll just explore that. And so that's an LOM who's doing a lot of that work. And importantly, you're not just kind of asking a chat GBT or something in a sort to go explore that and produce something, which it'll do. And honestly, it'll do in a pretty impressive way. But it's the way that we've built it is that it's grounded both inside of our, inside of the data for the project, because it has all that in one place. And then inside of the tools that we've fed it. So it knows how to use a, you know, how to down select actual vendors, or how to read spec sheets that we've fed it, or how to use simulation software that we fed it in order to derive these answers. What did you mention data centers? And I think you guys put that in as one of the categories you're most interested in. And in your announcement, what you guys unveiled, is that because we're building a lot of data centers? Or is that because there's like something specific to data centers and data center construction and engineering that makes it especially attractive here? Or is there something else that you would describe as like the perfect prototypical use case for this in the early days is X. So these projects have a handful of different reasons of why you would apply this technology. In the data center use case specifically, speed is really an important lever for them. And so you can take, you know, instead of the design portion taking, call it six to nine months of your critical path, we can massively collapse that period of time. And that's really important for these data center projects to kind of accelerate how quickly we can actually build them. The same piece though with the fact that, you know, if you right now budget six to nine months for your design portion, almost none of that you're going to start to figure out, well, how do we optimize that design or do some sort of value engineering to save costs or to design for long lead items or to design for constructability? So really strong value prop in these data center projects. As we as we end up kind of increasing the capacity that we have on our team, though, it'll make sense to pick up basically many of these types of large industrial projects, of which we've already pushed the kind of technology to be able to demonstrate. And it will end up being like really applicable across all types of construction. So if you can deliver more certainty up front, then that presumably is the thing that unlocks a different kind of business model that hopefully solves the incentive problem. Is that just a fixed price contract with no change orders allowed or what does that look like? That's exactly it. We literally put like no change orders in our contracts. So you wear the risk like you wear all the risk, basically. If there's a cost overrun, you're going to go negative on the project. And the premise here is that, because EPCs notoriously don't have huge margins, right? Construction firms are like high volume low margin type businesses. And so I guess that the thinking on your side has got to be because we're reducing the cost of everything along the way, we naturally have higher margins, which would allow us a little bit of a buffer if things do become a little more expensive than we expected. At least we're not like in the red. Is that, do I have that concept right? Yeah, I mean, we definitely will have a different margin profile than the industry, but it's not that, because even when you think about it, the engineering margin, it's like, it's pretty small because the spend of the engineering is actually really small relative to the larger construction scope of the project. The important part of what allows us to absorb that risk without the kind of risk that we go into the red or at least in a risk adjusted way is because we've been able to do so much design up front. And we've been able to not only kind of like remove all that extra risk by taking the definition instead of doing that at 30%, we can take that definition all the way through 100%. You just remove all this ambiguity of how much the thing should actually cost. So when you, again, traditionally, when someone gives a contract to go build a project, because they have such little core definition, they don't know all the vendors that they're going to buy from, they have, you even mentioned, I think this example earlier of like, there's like a tariff risk. By the time that you fund the project and you commit to a cost, tariff can change. In the six more months, you need to finish the design in order to order the parts. That doesn't exist in our world because we've been able to just very, very quickly remove all this risk before we actually commit to a price. That's very unique. Wait, how does that work? So that's a very, that's a good specific example. So I guess what you would do is issue the purchase order for all of the material before you commit to a price to the customer. Like, how do you avoid the tariff? Yeah, exactly. It's timing it all out. So when, just to compare this again to how it works today, is you'd only, when you say, hey, we're the EPC, we're going to give you a performance guarantee or some sort of fixed firm price when you go to buy this or fund this project with a notice to proceed or final investment decision. At that point, you just, you literally don't even know all your bocks. Like, so you're all your commodity equipment. You're the steel that you need, the wire that you need, etc. We will know all that at this point in time because we're not 30% definition, we're 100% engineering definition. And because we have this entire equipment list at this point in time, we know either how to say, hey, let's purchase everything at the same day that the project gets funded. Let's go either purchase everything or let's design hedges from a cost perspective so that we're not exposed to some sort of volatility or risk. That's complex. I'm thinking of these big construction projects. And you're either on the day that you sign the contract, you're either buying all of the steel, just as a random specific example, or you're hedging steel prices at the project by project level to make sure that you don't overpay for steel. That's what you need to do. Yeah. That's what allows you to truly have in a very different risk assessment for how these projects get built and that what gives you a ability to do a fixed firm and actually mean it. Most of these fixed firms aren't really like industry themselves. I mean, we've seen time and time again where it's like a fixed firm doesn't really mean a fixed firm because there's inevitably some way that in the thousand page contract that you assigned with your EPC, you went out of scope and invalidated that price. And that's the kind of change order trickery. I guess the other thing that I wonder how you manage is subcontractors, right? It's another area where change orders come from not just the general contractor, the EPC having to make a change order, but also because some subcontractor made a change order. So do you have to flow this all? First of all, are you going to use subcontractors? You're just going to do everything in house and have a ton of people on staff. And if you are going to use subcontractors, do you have to then flow this change in a structure down through all of them where they can't issue any change orders to you either? Yeah. Certainly long term, we will do everything in house. We will vertically integrate as much as possible because that's where you can fix the incentives all the way through. Yes, for these initial projects as we take, we are working friendly with like the local GC or even the trades, even the actual folks that we will subcontract a lot of this workout to. For that, it is making sure that we prior to entering into a contract. You have the kind of the same thing where often those contracts are not as the level of definition that you have when you're asking someone to actually give you a fixed price on what a scope of work is, is very hard. We don't have that same problem because we take things way deeper through definition. We have a much better understanding of what should this actually cost to go build. So yeah, there's a handful of different ways that we kind of approach working with the actual subcontractors as we do this to hit our performance goals. But it is this kind of like a continuing loop of how do you remove more and more risk through design? All right, so wrap it up. You don't have to give me exact numbers, but when should we expect to see the first COD? When should we expect to see the first project constructed by you guys? I love it. Yeah, well, hopefully see you next year. So hopefully by next year. Yeah. Fast is the rule. Alex, thank you so much for the time. Really appreciate it. I appreciate it. Thanks, Joe.

    "summary": "The podcast discusses the importance of monitoring incentives in the context of power scarcity affecting AI growth. Hyperscalers, like Amazon and Microsoft, are at the center of data center expansion and have incentives to highlight power constraints to drive infrastructure development. OEMs and service providers supplying data center equipment also benefit from promoting the power scarcity narrative to boost demand for their services. The conversation delves into the complexities of these incentives and the strategic decisions these players make in response to power challenges. Energy companies like Energy Hub and Bloom Energy offer solutions to address surging electricity demand and power AI operations efficiently.",

Latitude Media, covering the new frontiers of the energy transition. I'm Shale Khan, and this is Catalyst. Who has incentives to talk up the power constraints, and who may not have incentives to do that and maybe take the opposite view where it's actually not as big of a deal, and where my economic incentives actually inform or influence their views more than is appreciated by the market. Coming up, show me the incentive, and I'll show you the behavior. Surging electricity demand is testing the limits of the grid, but Energy Hub is helping utilities stay ahead. Energy Hub's platform transforms millions of connected devices, like thermostats, EVs, batteries, and more into flexible energy resources. That means more reliability, lower costs, and cleaner power without new infrastructure. Energy Hub partners with over 120 utilities nationwide to build virtual power plants that scale. Learn how the industry's leading flexibility provider is shaping the future of the grid. Visit energyhub.com. Clean energy is under attack, and it's more important than ever to understand why projects fail and how to get them back on track. The Center Left Think Tank third way surveyed over 200 clean energy professionals to answer that exact question.

I lead the early stage venture strategy and energy impact partners. Welcome. All right. So this episode is a reminder to always monitor incentives. More specifically, we're talking about the narrative and certainly the reality today around power scarcity as the rate limiter on the growth of AI. Everyone is talking about it. Actually, I saw a chart recently that showed the frequency of mentions of the word power or energy on S&P 500 earnings calls over time. And you can imagine the shape of this chart. It had been pretty steady, actually trending slightly downward over time until 2025 when the line literally went vertical. There's basically no question in my mind that power is actually a bottleneck for data center growth today and perhaps therefore for AI growth. That's sort of a truism. But it could also become a comfortable scapegoat depending on where things trend in AI world. And because it's convenient and because it's widely discussed, it's important to think one level below the surface about what you hear from various players in the market. That's why I really loved this recent post on X initially from Shano Matthew that we're discussing today. Shano's been on this pod before to talk about public market stuff because he's a senior vice president and portfolio manager for US sustainable equity at Lazar. But he recently went online and went meticulously through basically every player in the AI slash energy world and laid out their incentives. Should they drum up concern about power shortages? Should they downplay them? Should they capitalize on them? This conversation for me is foundational and should act sort of as a reference and a reminder for me anyway. Anytime I hear something new about energy and AI from one of the major players in the market. So let's go through it. Here's Sean who. Sean who welcome back. Hey, Shell. Thanks for having me on again. All right. So what got you started thinking about the incentives of all the different actors involved in data center power nexus? Like what sparked the thinking? It's a good question. I feel like everyone has been thinking about this for the last two years or at least hopefully so I don't feel as lonely. But I think the premise for this tweet or thought that I had was that there's general understanding that there's like a few ground fruits and ones like AI is a foundational technology that's going to persist in society. Two is we need a lot more energy infrastructure. The magnitude and duration of the cycle is of the debate, but it introduces a duration mismatch where technology is often done on cycles that are one to two years, whereas energy is typically multi year even multi decadal depending on the type of asset. And what I was trying to gear in is, you know, psychologically, humans or organizations have incentives and incentives drive behaviors as everyone knows. And how could we take that, you know, lens and apply it to the power debate? Because so many times I have folks coming to me from earnings calls or from events or conferences and saying, I heard this from X party or this from Y party. And that's completely at odds with what they heard from another player down the stack. And so what we were trying to do is a clean sheet exercise was looking up and down the supply stack for AI, who has incentives to talk up the power constraints and who may not have incentives to do that and maybe take the opposite view where it's actually not as big of a deal. And are there economic incentives that may inform or influence their behaviors? The goal wasn't to call out companies being misleading or anything like that. It's just namely to acknowledge where might, you know, economic incentives actually inform or influence or views more than is appreciated by the market. Yeah, I read the original post and it was like in some ways it's kind of obvious, but at the same time it was sort of like a lightning bolt to me. I was like, oh, yeah, like I hear this stuff constantly as well from every corner. Everybody is talking about the power bottleneck. And it is important to examine the incentives that drive anybody's behavior or the narrative that anybody's telling about it, not because there isn't a power bottleneck. I think you and I probably agree. Like there is for sure. 100%. But the magnitude, the duration and certainly it probably won't always be one. And so, you know, as this goes through whatever cycle it's going to go through, we need to be paying attention to like who is saying what and examining the incentives that drive that. So I thought it was super interesting. And what I wanted to do with you is kind of talk through some of them, what we are hearing from these areas parties and then the incentives that they have to say what they are saying or maybe to say what they're not saying. But let's start by categorizing, like walk me through at the high level. Like they're a bunch of, there are a couple groupings of actors that have similar incentives. So how do you think about the groupings? Yeah, at a high level, I'll try to keep it simple. But, you know, again, there's various degrees and nuance required. But at a high level, you know, let's start with the hyperscalers who are the folks that are driving a lot of this CapEx and investment cycle. You know, these are, think of it as like the cloud service providers, the Amazon's, the Microsoft's of the world as well as including meta, which is another hyperscaler, even though they don't have a legacy cloud business. That drives investment spend on GPUs and that's kind of the equipment. Like you have the technology hardware, if you will, that includes GPUs, CPUs, custom silicon offerings. That moves upstream into like the supporting equipment, which includes electrical and cooling equipment. And then if you kind of go outside the data center, then you start to get into, you know, who supplies that power equipment as well as the overall actual power of the facility and moving upstream there is like, you know, who actually builds power, which is like utilities, as well as, you know, the labor and the EPCs and engineer and that goes into those types of facilities. So if you kind of just go from who spent in the capital and follow that down the stream, that's a general way to think about some of these bigger pockets. And so I happen to jump into any of those. All right. So let's, let's start with the hyperscalers. They're obviously at the epicenter of the data center build out. How do you think about their incentive when they talk about power? Definitely. And I think this is the most interesting from a, from a game theory standpoint. So just a backup for the, for the audience that may not be entirely clear, right? The hyperscalers have really strong incumbent businesses, you know, oftentimes depending on your talk about cloud or digital advertising. And they think that the spend on AI allows them, you know, a better product opportunity in the future such that they can accelerate growth of cloud or advertising offerings or it'll enhance our product offerings, which, you know, it leads to better returns over time. And so you have two options to go out and get more capacity, right? One, they build their own capacity, but then two, they also can go out and procure capacity on the external market. And that comes from Neo clouds or co locators or things that we can get into. But if you think about it from their perspective, right, building your own capacity is typically what they prefer because they have control and we're doing integration when they have the chance to, because they, you know, they have these, they have teams internally, they have the expertise. But when you go back to that core issue, right, is that I think everyone agrees that we need more energy. I think what the uncertainty comes in is how much energy do we need? And if you think about it from the perspective of them, if I have to go out and build all this infrastructure and this infrastructure is, you know, beyond the next few years, I need to, you know, potentially potentially be comfortable underwriting it for the next 10 20 better just a natural mismatch, right, where it's like, okay, do I want to be the long term risk taker of the assets that I'm underwriting? I might be comfortable doing that to an extent. But beyond that, do I perhaps let the market figure out the excess capacity? So if you're a hyperscaler, the argument forward be if I really think that this is like the greatest demand super cycle and I'm severely constrained, I might try to go out and build as much as possible in the procure all the extra. The, you know, the skeptic or the pessimistic view would be they see line of sight into the demand they need and that's all they're going to be comfortable building to and the rest of the market sort out and such. So if you think about that from a power standpoint, my incentive in that scenario would be to talk up power constraints, right? Saying that there's not nearly enough of it. We need to build so much. Like this is the greatest cycle because that will incent speculators, developers, other companies like neo clouds and stuff that want to compete for leases from hyperscalers to go out and build infrastructure. And this one's interesting because Satya and Nadella, for example, the CEO of Microsoft kind of told you this actually on a podcast earlier this year or the late last year, he was on dark question, talked about when he was asked, why not commit more resources to building more assets? And he ultimately said, well, I'm seeing a lot of activity from developers and co-locators and neo clouds. And I think that I might be able to procure cheap supply in the future because who benefits if there is an overbuild or too much build and conditions loosen, that means cheaper leases for them. And that might be cheaper than actually going out and building your own catbacks. And so that's kind of the game theory of one or the other in terms of why build or why when I might just wait to see how the chips may fall. They're complicated, I think, because you can see it going either way. On one hand, they clearly have an incentive to say that there is this massive bottleneck in the form of power and power infrastructure because that hopefully from their perspective incentivizes the world to build more of that stuff so that they can build more data centers. So they should be shouting from the rooftops, this is the bottleneck. Also by the way, it's convenient that it may indeed be true, but it's also convenient for them to be like, the bottleneck is definitely power. That means it's definitely not demand for their services. And again, that may be true today, but they could say that even if it weren't true, and that would be helpful to them. So to me, there's a very clear incentive for them to say this power bottleneck is huge and insurmountable and we need to have a mobilization, the likes of which we've never seen in the energy sector to solve it. On the other hand, if they don't solve it, if the world doesn't solve it, I should say they are probably better positioned than anybody to snatch up the scarce resource that is the available power supply in the sense that if they are going to be forced to build their own capacity, which many folks are doing, who's in a better position to write long lead orders for a G, vernova turbines, than the hyperscalers who have big balance sheets and can afford to pay for it and so on. So there is an extent to which if you're scared of the neoclouds, for example, and you're a hyperscaler, you don't necessarily entirely want the world to solve the power bottleneck for you because it's sort of a source of competitive advantage, at least against that other class. My guess is that between those two incentives, the one that says, no, we just want the world to solve the power problem because our job is AI, that's probably the one that wins out, but it doesn't seem pure as the driven snow to me, that it's like that clear. You hit it on the head, right? I think it's really, really complex when you pull it back to layers. I think the one thing I would add, right, is that a lot of the motivator for spending all those cap X is that each dollar of capacity not online that could be served, could be serving additional demand is revenue dollars that you're not making. And so that opportunity cost is so great of not having power. So to your point, you may be comfortable, especially on, for example, a gigawatt data center being $50 billion, spending X dollars of millions of dollars procuring deposits for long lead items, turbines, electrical equipment, switch gears, circuit breaks, et cetera, just to make sure that the long lead items are actually settled to build. So if the power is there, then you can go ahead and plug the shells in immediately. But there is an ability to walk away or cancel or just lose it a positive contract as well. But their incentive would be to lock up as much capacity to your point as possible, right? Because they want to have the optionality. But I think they also are playing for worst case scenario, you can walk away from a few million dollar deposits. And I'm just speaking hypothetically here versus the opportunity cost of building a multi-billion dollar data center. So there is all these different levers they can pull, but it definitely feels that they're keeping optionality. And then just to be clear, too, they are bringing on a lot of their own capacity, right? Amazon brought on 3.8 gigawatts in the last 12 months. So they're going to double their footprint in the next two years. Microsoft said they're going to double as well. And they brought on two gigawatts in the last 12 months. So they are bringing on a ton of capacity as well. But it is just interesting to see they're also striking deals in the new cloud. So are they the bull would say that there's nowhere near enough supply and then they're forced to do that? And the bear would say, well, actually, there is want the speculative risk to go to the new clouds and then they can walk away from the contracts if market conditions deteriorate. And it's, I think no one really knows. You know, time will tell. The grid wasn't built for what's coming next. Electricity demand is surging from data centers to EVs and utilities, they need reliable, portable solutions that don't require building expensive new infrastructure. Energy Hub helps by turning everyday devices like smart thermostats, EVs, home batteries, and more into virtual power plants. These flexible energy resources respond in near real time to grid needs, balancing supply and demand. Plus, they can be deployed in under a year and at 40 to 60 percent lower cost than traditional infrastructure. That means more reliability, lower costs, cleaner energy, you can't get much better than that. And that is why over 120 utilities across North America trust Energy Hub to manage more than 1.8 million devices. Learn more at energyhub.com or click the link in the show notes. Do you ever wonder why it takes so long to get clean energy projects up and running? Do you have permitting reform on the brain? Are you NEPA reform curious? The new paste study from Third Way pinpoints the non-cost barriers that stand in the way of clean energy deployment and keep new solar and transmission projects in limbo. We surveyed more than 200 industry professionals to understand what's slowing down deployment and offer practical solutions on how to fix it.

AI data centers are being told that it will take years to get grid power. They can't afford to wait, so they're turning to on-site power solutions like bloom energy. Bloom can deliver clean, ultra reliable, affordable power that's always on in as little as 90 days. Bloom's fuel cells offer data centers other important advantages. They adapt to volatile AI workloads. They have an ultra low emissions profile that usually allows for faster and simpler permitting and their cost effective too. That's why leaders from across the industry trust Bloom to power their data centers. Ready to power your AI future? Get bloom energy.com to learn more. All right, there's another grouping of actors here where my first instinct to say is that it actually is straightforward with their incentives are, which is let's just say OEMs of hardware to data centers. That could be your selling equipment inside the data center or maybe not even hardware. Let's include like EPCs here, for example, as well. Your job is to provide services or hardware into the build of data centers. My first thought would be everybody there is aligned in their incentive to promote the power scarcity narrative. It's just furthers the argument that there is limitless demand for their services and we're just going to sell out as much as we possibly can. Do you think it's more complex than that? I think that one is pretty straightforward to your point is that just going back to our prior point about long lead time items and the most constrained a lot of this equipment as well as the labor. Those are the direct beneficiaries. What do they get? They get higher backlogs. They get longer duration backlogs. They get better pricing in typically industries where you don't get, you basically get minimal pricing or as much as the market will bear. Whereas now you have pricing power for the first time in generations for certain equipment providers or certain labor producers. So this one is pretty straightforward and you see that across the earnings, right? You can look at the earnings transcripts of companies like Quanta, like record backlog, MossTech talking about record activity in their pipeline business as well as really a strong, even clean energy pipeline. You can go to equipment or you see something like a verdive which has a backlog that was up 30% organically over year. You have Eaton which is up 20% backlog organically over year. Like billion dollar books of business. So I think there, that's what you'll see to your point, a very limited narrative on talking down the potential market opportunity because if you think about it from their point of view, right? It's just more and more business to your point, right? Equipment, as you are power scarce, you need the latest and greatest to be the most power efficient per square foot or per IT capacity per megawatt of IT capacity. And so you always want the latest and greatest and often the highest priced equipment as well as you want to continually get the latest generation which requires you to size up the low-order equipment. In terms of the labor, if labor is the most constrained element, that means that you'll agree to perhaps a higher degree of pricing that you normally would where if conditions were scarce, you may be forced to just take or whatever conditions that your buyers are willing to take. So for example, electricians and plumbers, we're incredibly scarce there right now. I mean, there's market chatter of companies like the hyperscalers flying out electricians from various parts of the country because they don't have enough labor. So you can imagine for the CPC companies, pricing power is great because they're the only ones that have labor and can actually go out and deploy these projects. In an environment where that doesn't look as favorable, right, you have to agree to tighter terms, you have less overall products to work on, you have more than enough supply of labor folks. That means that your market will slow down and your pricing slowed down. So like that is a vicious down cycle in terms of what happens on the other side of a growth cycle. Right. So this bucket, generally I agree with you straightforward, talk up the business opportunity. It generally is positive and supportive for their businesses. All right. So let's talk about another one that I think of as being a little bit more complex then, which is utilities. Like on one hand, utilities are in the same position as everybody else we've discussed, which is basically like, look, if there's a huge bottleneck in power, clearly demand for their services, in this case, electrons is going to be through the roof. They're going to be able to spend more capex. They should get higher earnings. Like this should be good for utilities. And so of course they would want to talk up the power scarcity narrative. On the other hand, folks sometimes blame the utilities for the power scarcity challenge. And like who is there to solve it but them to some extent? So there's probably some limit to the extent to which they can blame the or place the limitation of AI growth on power scarcity. So I wonder how you think about them and what you've been hearing from them when they talk in public market contexts. Definitely. I think this is one of the positions that is not enviable for a lot of different market players, especially those in the other buckets. Because you bring up a great point where on the one side generational capex cycle, I can get a guaranteed ROE on my investments and I can put through more investments. The downside is we are increasingly seeing the political issues around rising electricity rates as well as folks being against having data centers in their local environment. So on the positive side, it's like a potential business opportunity on the negative side. I'm getting increasing amounts of pushback. And ultimately utilities are regulated, right? They need to answer to a public utility commission and get the infrastructure they need approved. And so now they're in this interesting predicament where they have to solve for all these limitations, right? They have to bring on as much infrastructure as possible but also do it at the lowest cost or at least the most efficient use of dollars such that they can't be blamed for inefficiently spending capital or artificially inflating demand. So I think utilities where the last few quarters, right, you talked or even probably the last one, two years, it was a lot more talking about the gigawatt pipeline and how much they're growing and you know, you have folks throwing out tens of gigawatts in their pipeline or hundreds of gigawatts. And now it's talking a little bit more about how can we bring these gigawatts on in a very effective way and then ensuring that they have the labor, they have the equipment, they have the ability to execute on this quickly. Some of these are also in regions, right, where they're impacted by regulatory impacts such as like Texas with SB six or PJ M just actually went through and they couldn't get to a resolution on what's the, you know, approach to large load tariffs. But you're right, utilities are conflicted in the sense that they don't want to miss out on the opportunity, right? Because if they can't bring on the power or they aren't permitted to bring on the power, someone will take their load elsewhere to a different utility. And so they're in the business of problem solving right now, whereas, you know, it will last one to two years, talk about the opportunity. Now it's in the realm of can I do this effectively and cost efficiently. How do you think about the, there's another category, which is like the, I'll group together like real estate owners, landowners, and then the, the like powered land developers, the developers who are going off and trying to find sites and make them powered and then sell them to a colo or a hyperscaler or whoever. What's their incentive? Their incentive is to talk up the constraints as well because it increases the value of the yes to their owning, which is the real estate or the powered land bank. If we think about solving again, if there's a constraint, that means that anything that accelerates you through the constraint is valuable, right? Or it increases in value as a constraint gets worse or it remains. And so if I have a powered land bank, that means that I can move a lot faster than someone that has just a plot of land that has no interconnection access or anything like that, right? So I can charge a more premium price to developers or neoclouds, et cetera. Anyone else that would want to be further along up the development cycle. And so they're generally universally talking up the opportunity that they have and the ability to move faster. I'd say a lot of what we're seeing there is at least what we hear, chatter-wise, is that your transaction values that are much higher than they've ever been, or at least in recent cycles, as folks all are chasing the similar opportunity. So pretty much any land banks that are powered, that are near plentiful energy sources, something like in the Northeast with Narrow Gasfields or in West Texas, right? You're seeing construction activity be plentiful because people think that it's a much faster path to value realization. So you're seeing that increasingly move up. I think one tall tell signal or maybe a leading indicator that could start to suggest weakness is if you start to see real estate offerings that are powered, that are near tier one cities or have really good access to energy infrastructure or fiber infrastructure that don't get a premium value or are struggling to sell in the market, that would be an interesting indicator that perhaps the market's not as strong as possible. But at least right now, the market indicators would suggest that value is considerable because people are still focused on time to power right now. All right, I want to move on to the chip players. They're an interesting one here. If you think about Nvidia's incentives, on one hand, they share the incentives that most of these other folks do of let's play up the power constraint in the hope that it gets solved. On the other hand, they want to be making the argument that we are just going to sell effectively infinite chips forever. They're just going to sell so, so, so, so many more GPUs. If power is a real constraint on that, that's the limiting factor and it's outside their control, then one would think that would affect their perceived value and their perceived growth, I would say. My sense is that Nvidia is talking kind of like the hyperscalers and really the story they're telling is this is a major constraint. Possibly just because it's true, but maybe that's their incentive as well. Yes, and I think they actually, if again, this is all very hypothetical game theory, but if you are in the video, right, like you are pitching that you are getting the best performance token per watt is, you know, what Jensen will call it. And basically arguing that they can extract the most tokens per watt useful energy. And so they're giving you the lowest cost efficient dollar to the highest level of performance. And so that actually gives them pricing power, right? Because since we are power constrained and that constraint is expected to get worse and power prices rise, the Nvidia chip holders actually, the TCO advantage that they have versus less efficient chips actually goes up in that scenario, right? So they actually continue to do better as power remains constrained because it reinforces their pricing power. And so this introduces like the recent, like, you know, the interesting angle where like custom silicon, for example, for those, you know, TPUs or all the raises this week, even though they've been in existence for a while, there's arguments that you can find more purposeful chips for certain workloads that require less energy draws. And if, you know, you weren't as constrained on energy, you might be, or you might be willing to use some of those chips, that actually erodes your pricing power for Nvidia, right? Because the idea is we're power constrained. I want to get the maximum amount of knowledge for every dollar I spend. And I can do that right now with Nvidia chips that I might not be able to do with custom silicon chips. And so it actually reinforces their competitive advantage. And so they have a kind of an interesting angle here where to your point, they're going to sell more and more chips and you need power to bring online those chips. So they also probably want the market to rain tight because the longer it's tight, the better their pricing power actually ends up being. So on balance, basically, everybody we've talked about so far, you know, sometimes it's nuanced, but pretty much everybody is incentivized to play up the power bottleneck. And indeed, you know, they are. It is also real, but they are playing it up. Who do you think is on the other side of this equation? Like who is incentivized to say that power is not such a big bottleneck? Yeah. I think this part's a little bit more interesting, too, because to your point, I feel like a lot of people benefit if the power constraint remains. And you know, that's just like a okay thing to observe is just facts or facts. But on the other side, you know, I called a few buckets and the first that I think is independent power producers. And this might seem counterintuitive, but let me lay out my logic is if you're an independent power producer, that means that you have a fleet of existing assets today, those generate money based on selling into electricity markets. And so, you know, the input to their revenue is electricity prices. If we're in scarce conditions and those continue to grow, they generate a really healthy incremental margin on that, right? Because they're not really building out new assets. You have slightly higher O and M, perhaps by running your assets harder, but you're just flowing through a high electricity price. That is extremely profitable for them. And that's actually been the thesis for a lot of owning these assets. So these are like the constellations, the talents, the energies of the world. One thing I noticed, it's interesting. If you look at the like the last two earnings calls, right, you have the folks like the CEO of Constellation talking about the fact that, you know, energy prices actually aren't supportive of building new gas plants, which may or may not be true. And that, you know, there's operically, there's different items that we have or levers to pull like flexibility or, you know, things of like tile nurses suggestion of, you know, throttling workloads when you're at peak conditions to enable more excess capacity to be built and used today. I think that's interesting that the IPPs are talking out of that because like if you game theory it out, it basically is suggesting that perhaps they don't want a lot of new supply to enter the market, right? Because what does that do? That potentially dampens prices. And they, I just laid out a path where they can generate a lot more healthier e-buds if they can, you know, sell into higher or appreciating power price markets. And so I think that's someone that is probably trying to downplay the impact just because their value in the marketplace goes up as long as this constraint, you know, remains. And, you know, another area that I think is a little bit more interesting too. And it's almost a derivative of how the market works, but like LNG providers, for example, a lot of them just sign very like long-term, you know, contracts. And then the basic arbitrage in US LNG is you buy cheap domestic gas and then you sell it to other markets like Asia or Europe to be able to, you know, sell into premium markets. Their model actually gets a little bit in trouble here or the ARB gets less interesting if domestic gas prices rise, right? Because you go from taking a cheap input to a rapidly inflating input that's maybe no longer cheap and that kills your ARB on the other side too. So they're probably incentivized as well to talk down some of the power issues to ensure that the supply goes to them versus going to a local market that they can be served much more profitably as well. So that's like two areas at least that came to mind in terms of the other side of the trade where, you know, perhaps trying to talk down the power constraint issue so that new supply doesn't enter the market and you can have to continue to, you know, raise your prices. That also, you know, another area would be like, just thinking about that a lot now, is the natural gas EMPs also as well, right? If everyone's just chasing this glut, then you probably bring on more production that actually keeps a lid on your prices when you want prices to be rising. So I think the way to think about this one is who benefits from a rising input price to their business models and they're probably in the camp of talking down expectations. Right. That's kind of where, I guess, of those three groups, I think the IPPs in the natural gas EMP companies are kind of aligned, right? They both benefit from high prices of their commodity so they don't want a ton of new capacity to get built. That's just good for them. The LNG folks are on the other side of that trade, right? They're buying the natural gas that gets produced and selling into another market. So they don't want prices to rise. They do want more production. They want as much drilling as possible, right? And so then the R gets bigger. So for them, again, this is complicated in theory, but like, but, you know, with the LNG players, you'd think they'd want to say, oh, it's a, you know, they should be telling you that we're talking about the power bottle neck. It's actually a natural gas bottle neck. We need to be drilling so, so much more. And if that happens, then it keeps their prices low and keeps their arm big. Yeah. So that's a really interesting point though, right? Because like, yes, they want natural gas production to be high because that means low, but they also don't want local sources of demand to accelerate because that means you have a lot more willing buyers in this case gas power plants, right? So if a bunch of CCGTs go up, then all of a sudden you have a local buyer that's willing to pay a premium price that raises the input price for them. They want to buy cheap neck gas, but all of a sudden, if you have local demand that goes, you know, incredibly higher, you're competing with another source and, you know, producer might be able to go to somewhere else versus you and that impacts your ability to serve your contracts on a longer term time horizon. So it is, it is complicated as you get, as you start to peel the onions, the layers of the onion back, you start to see all this, like, you know, there is general incentives like for and against it within all these pockets, but it is just like, it's hard to parse out without going through these exercises and say like, who benefits in what market? And that's the, the, the rule or the role that investors play, right? Because we're generally trying to underwrite the range of scenarios, good, bad, neutral, and then probability weight, what's most likely to happen. Maybe taking a step back, I guess, just to wrap it up, it seems clear to me that this, this narrative, this general narrative of the power bottleneck has taken hold substantially over the past. I don't know, you tell me, but 12, 18 months, something like that is when it's really taken hold. How would you describe the sentiment around that narrative today? And like, have you seen it changing at all? Is it, is the fervor growing right now? Like, where are we in the trajectory of people talking about this problem? Yeah. At characterizer at a high level, the last one or two years was really just getting our heads around the issue. What's the source of this demand? How strong is it? And that's largely driven by GPUs and say, all right, we need the latest and greatest to train our models, scaling loss hold. That means we can justify more investment and we'll continue to perpetuate the cycle. I think what it turned into recently now is folks are getting into that ROIC question. It's like, all the dollars that we're spending, which is on the order of half a trillion dollars now a year, is that generating positive ROIC? And that question mandates, are they generating revenue and dollars from it? And so that moves you upstream to, okay, like our folks actually doing that. And then that leads to the area where there's the question of, if I had more supply, could I generate more dollars and would the ROIC on each of those dollars be positive? And that's the part that we're in right now is what is the real constraint here? If you talk to a lot of the providers that sell AI solutions, it's because we don't have enough power shelves or power to get more supply online and that'd be able to generate more dollars. But I think that's like the real question is like, if said another way, if we had unlimited power or unlimited constraints now that were all solved, would the AI trajectory still be as strong as it is today? And that's the question that we're getting into is like, which constraints are these are solvable? And if those constraints are relieved, does the cycle perpetuate positive for that player or negative? And I think right now as folks are trying to answer that question, and that's why you see kind of the gyration that you do in the market every other day, right? Where, for example, a lot of the AI power trade or AI plumbing trade, wherever you want to call it for physical infrastructure has done tremendously well for the last few years. I think folks oftentimes think about it as just Nvidia, but the names, like a lot of the companies that we talked about earlier, like the, the EMP, the, the EPCs, the MEP subcontractors, the networking and optical connectivity equipment, the switch gears, the circuit breakers, the transformers, the chillers, all these people have benefited. And so now it's just about the durability of those constraints because that's ultimately what we're trading on now is like the two, three, four years outward. Can they actually grow into what the valuations have grown to? All right, Johnny, this was fun. Thank you for helping me think through all the complicated incentives that are out there mainly to just talk about how big a problem power is. But we'll have you back on when things take a turn as they inevitably will. Yeah, it'll be a fun to try to tag along and we'll see what happens here and the narratives are always constantly changing and the market's giving new opportunities to new narratives.

Latitude media covering the new frontiers of the energy transition. I'm Shell Kahn, and this is Catalyst. It was quite dramatic that the Secretary of Energy, Secretary Wright, wrote this letter to FERC saying, here's a rulemaking I'm putting before you on access to the grid. It strongly proves the point the whole AI industry needs the grid and that this current administration is willing to do anything and everything to support AI. So now we need to see the next step of, okay, well, let's expand the grid. Coming up, transmission, transmission. Surging electricity demand is testing the limits of the grid, but Energy Hub is helping utilities stay ahead. Energy Hub's platform transforms millions of connected devices, like thermostats, EVs, batteries, and more into flexible energy resources. That means more reliability, lower costs, and cleaner power without new infrastructure. Energy Hub partners with over 120 utilities nationwide to build virtual power plants that scale. And how the industry's leading flexibility provider is shaping the future of the grid, visit energyhub.com. Clean energy is under attack, and it's more important than ever to understand why projects fail and how to get them back on track. The center left think tank, Third Way, surveyed over 200 clean energy professionals to answer that exact question. Their newest study identifies the top non-cost barriers to getting projects over the finish line, from permitting challenges to nimbism, to read Third Way's full report, and to learn more about their pace initiative, visit thirdway.org slash pace, or click the link in the show notes. The AI boom is here, but the grid wasn't built for it. Bloom Energy is helping the AI industry take charge. Bloom Energy delivers affordable, always-on, ultra-reliable on-site power.

I lead the early stage venture capital strategy at Energy Impact Partners. Welcome. Apologies for my singing voice. We're talking transmission this week because I had robbed Gramlich on a year ago, a little over a year ago, to talk about the woeful state of US transmission build-out, which has truly been embarrassing for the past decade or so, and even worse in recent years. We talked about all the reasons why that was true and what might change and so on. I'd say the outlook was we're in a tough spot and a bunch of things need to change in order for us to start building significant transmission lines again. Just as a reminder, we need to build new transmission lines for lots of reasons. We need to integrate lots more renewables on the grid and other generation. Also now, we need to serve all of this new load that's showing up in the former data centers. The need is doubled. That speaks to why I want to have the conversation again today, which is a lot has changed in the past year in the electricity sector. Things in other parts of the market have changed substantially. Transmission may or may not be the hardest thing to change. I wanted to see whether all of the rapid change, all of the money that is flowing into the sector has moved the needle on building out new high voltage power lines in the US. I brought back Rob Gramlich from Grid Strategies to do an update. Here's Rob. Rob, welcome back. Thanks, Cheryl. Could we with you? All right. Great talk on this podcast a little over a year ago about transmission and new transmission, I would say, in particular in the US. It was a tale of woes and a big long exclamation of how amazing it is that we've been able to build so little transmission new high voltage transmission in particular in the United States in the past decade or so. I wanted to have you back on because the past year has changed many things about the electricity sector. I wonder whether it has changed this thing. My high level question for you is, do you think we're in a fundamentally different position with regard to your outlook on new transmission build in the US relative to a year ago or is it more the same place? Well, we're still struggling to put the pieces together. I think we do have a good platform that actually has a pretty decent shot of surviving the political change we've all experienced because transmission is so critical for data centers and AI driven data center demand. We don't really know that for sure yet. Things are just sort of getting settled with the relevant agencies here in Washington Department of Energy and FERC. So we don't really know how that's going to turn out. We did actually have an uptick in new lines in 2024. So that was new because I think when we spoke, we were talking about how there were only 55 miles of new high voltage transmission lines in 2023, which is down a trickle from the 4,000 that had been built 10 years prior, which hopefully I wasn't all well with me. What was us? I mean, I do like to point at that experience 10 years ago and say, hey, look, we were able, in this country, with all the permitting challenges we have to build 4,000 miles of new high voltage transmission. I connected all this clean energy. So there is hope and we like to point to that example of saying, look, when we get the pieces together, right, we can do this, but then some things happened and we went down to a trickle of only 55 miles. Well, there wasn't an uptick to like 880-ish miles in 2024. So that's some good news. When I first saw that, I thought, oh, great, we're starting to turn things around. But if you look a little bit closer, you kind of see, oh, wait a minute, these were lines that were begun 10 or 15 years ago that just finally got finished. You could say, all right, that's a good story because a number of these did need federal permits from federal agencies. And I think during the Biden administration, they were approving transmission projects. And so that's good news and that could continue, might not continue in the current administration. We don't know yet. But there wasn't uptick. So in some ways, we've gotten some permitting. But some of the key policies like at FERC in order 1920, it could be branded as a democratic thing. I think it was bipartisan and it actually had no preferences for renewable energy or anything like that. So I think it should be safe and robust to a partisan change with new commissioners coming in. But we don't know yet. We don't know what the new commissioners are going to do about 1920. Are they going to implement it or just kind of render it sort of a dead letter and do it in a week or do you just briefly re-describe 1920? Sure. So that was the order. I asked the issue a few years ago for proactive long-term transmission planning, 20-year plans for each region. So it applies to the grid operators like PJM and MISO and SPP and California ISO, but also to the non-RTO utilities they need to get with their neighbors and put regional plans together. And so significant order, very well crafted in my opinion, Chairman Glick and his team separated it through and Commissioner Clemens and others, Chairman and then Commissioner Christie was there for the latter part of it. He made some changes. So it kind of wound up very sort of bipartisan. And technology neutral, which is fine. But it's there. Should be done. The courts will have their say, hopefully people will revoke their challenges from the courts and just let it stay as it is. And then hopefully FERC will actually implement it with teeth and not just accept any old thing that comes in on compliance. But that is the next step is the region's father. Compliance approaches with FERC and FERC kind of on the margin can either make it be a weak rule or remain a strong rule. I mean, is this the fundamental reason why things, so like in other parts of the electricity world, things have changed a lot in the past year, right? And it's driven by just the, it's like necessity is the mother of invention. It's a combination of necessity is the mother invention. And there is essentially an endless pool of money willing to throw itself at any solution that gets more power to data centers faster. Is the reason why this hasn't, like transmission hasn't benefited from that, that like the only way to solve it is kind of, it's like what you're describing. It's like a FERC order that has to go through the ISO's that takes years to go through the process. And so it's just inherently a slower thing because you could imagine a scenario where sort of similar to what we're seeing in other categories, right? Like hyperscaler wants to build data center and strikes a deal with utility where they can get interconnected faster if they pay for 100 miles of new 765 kV line or something like that. You think that kind of thing would be happening. Yeah, I think it's just, it's not right in the bullseye of the data centers immediate need or the utilities immediate need. It's sort of the background infrastructure that everybody relies on and absolutely you need to build up that network, that backbone network to support all this new load. And it's not the obvious thing. It's not what incoming officials at the Department of Energy immediately go to as, oh, here's immediately what we need to go focus on. And it's not, it doesn't catch a lot of the press attention. A lot of the press attention is about, oh, look at this onsite generation option or a new, now we're doing rice generators or this or that or the other onsite option. For some reason, more attention. But I mean, my understanding from the hyperscalers and the data center developers is that they all really, really want the full network transmission service with all of the good backup and cushion that that network provides to their operations and the five nines reliability that you only get that way. And so I think the message is starting to filter through the process. I mean, it was quite dramatic that the Secretary of Energy, Secretary Wright, wrote this letter to FERC saying, here's a rulemaking I'm putting before you on access to the grid. Right. But it's not really, it doesn't really have anything about transmission in it, right? Well, it's access to transmission. And then so the next, it begs the next question of, well, if you care that much to do this dramatic order that's almost never used authority and take all the beating from state regulators who would be losing some jurisdiction, if you're willing to do that, well, then you must care about the size of the grid, the actual capacity of the grid. What's access to a grid if it has no capacity for you? So to me, it strongly proves the point that the whole AI industry, if you want to call it that, needs the grid and that this current administration, which is willing to do anything and everything to support AI being done in this country, it proves that the transmission network is critical to that because they're taking this major action to get access to the transmission grid. So now we need to see the next step of, okay, well, let's expand the grid and all the things that come with that, which is order 1920 and then interregional transmission and then using the DOE programs like the transmission facilitation program we could go on. But there are a lot of things that FERC and DOE can do to actually enable the expansion of the grid. Is this a little bit of a tragedy of the commons kind of a problem? A hundred percent. Yeah, it's where it's like any given data center company needs transmission expansion, but you can't attribute that transmission build out to that specific data center necessarily. And so they can't say, I will put down money for you to build out new transmission lines specifically for me. And as a result, it gets pushed down the order of priority list because they're like, okay, immediate concern is getting this data center connected to the grid. So instead, I'm just going to go buy a bunch of gas generators or whatever it is. Exactly right. Look, these hyperscalers, and you and I know them all, and I'm sure we both have many friends that at each of them, they're an intense competition with each other. To the point where the people I know at the hyperscaler, they don't actually know which data centers are being developed for their company because it's so commercially sensitive that only a few people, even in the company, know which ones they're really planning to go forward with. And so if they're in that intense competition, like company to company, then it's of much less interest, just much less incentive for them to go work on the network that all of their competitors get to use just as much as they do. So that's classic public good, tragedy the commons. And it's the reason why in this scenario, this is a classic reason why you have government leadership. And as a nation, if we are in an AI race with China, then we should be using federal leadership to build out the network for all of those data centers here that want to be in this country and operating here in the Middle East or Asia or wherever else. And so for this to happen right, you really need federal leadership. States and regions can do a lot as well and localities, but we really need to build out the transmission network, which is an interstate federally regulated network. The grid wasn't built for what's coming next. Electricity demand is surging from data centers to EVs and utilities, they need reliable affordable solutions that don't require building expensive new infrastructure. Energy Hub helps by turning everyday devices like smart thermostats, EVs, home batteries, and more into virtual power plants. These flexible energy resources respond in near real time to grid needs, balancing supply and demand. Plus they can be deployed in under a year and at 40 to 60 percent lower cost than traditional infrastructure. That means more reliability, lower costs, cleaner energy, you can't get much better than that. And that is why over 120 utilities across North America trust Energy Hub to manage more than 1.8 million devices. Learn more at energyhub.com or click the link in the show notes. Do you ever wonder why it takes so long to get clean energy projects up and running? Do you have permitting reform on the brain? Are you NEPA reform curious? The new pace study from Third Way pinpoints the non-cost barriers that stand in the way of clean energy deployment and keep new solar and transmission projects in limbo. They surveyed more than 200 industry professionals to understand what's slowing down deployment and offer practical solutions on how to fix it.

AI data centers are being told that it will take years to get grid power. They can't afford to wait, so they're turning to on-site power solutions like Bloom Energy. Bloom can deliver clean, ultra reliable, affordable power that's always on in as little as 90 days. Bloom's fuel cells offer data centers other important advantages. They adapt to volatile AI workloads. They have an ultra low emissions profile that usually allows for faster and simpler permitting and their cost effective too. That's why leaders from across the industry trust Bloom to power their data centers. Ready to power your AI future? Visit bloom energy.com to learn more. Let me throw a couple of recent announcements at you and just get your take on like what how big a deal is this and what does it mean. One was, I think just recently, SPP, Southwest Power Pool, got I think approval to build this 765 KV transmission backbone as they called it. That sounds quite positive. How big a deal is that? Yeah, that plan, the ITP plan is huge. I went back and forth and I don't know the final number in terms of it might be closer to the 10 billion version rather than the $20 billion version. Yeah, it's like 8.6 or something. It was the IRAD. Okay, so it got unfortunately cut back. I hope there's a way. Here's another way. The federal government could come in and say, hey, for AI race with China, we want to get you back up to the $20 billion and we're going to help you. But hopefully it ain't over until it's over on that. At any rate, directionally, it's fantastic. A 765 KV collector loop with, I mean, anybody's favorite generation source is available in that Great Plains footprint and the market will decide which ones go forward. But there certainly could be a tremendous amount of clean energy that connects to that system and powers a tremendous amount of data center and new manufacturing and other load in that area. Okay, so now an announcement that points in the opposite direction, which is that the DOE, the Loan Programs Office, canceled the loan guarantee that was going to be offered to the Greenbelt Express project. So it's your point. It seems from all the other indications that this administration would be super in favor of new transmission build out. That cancellation seems like an odd decision in light of that. What do you make of it? Yeah, so many people interpreted that as so maybe they don't care about transmission. I don't interpret it that way. I think that was a very unique circumstance where a senator decided to use his minutes in the Oval Office to talk about a specific loan to a specific transmission line. Okay, that's not going to happen very often in the future. And if it does, anytime a senator uses his time with the president to talk about a specific loan to a specific line, that project, that loan anyway will be in trouble. The project, I expect, will go forward. It's a great project. But that loan is no longer. So I just think, I mean, presidents do things at the request of senators sometimes and that's what happened. Okay, I guess the way to ask this question is you said before, like, okay, did the extent that we built anything out recently, it's been stuff that was in the works for the past 10 years, et cetera. So presumably we should have pretty good visibility then into how much we will build for the next two, three, four, five years. How much is it? Yeah, I think it's looking pretty good. I mean, you've got 765 KV AC plans. We mentioned SPP, but MISO in the more of the, like, the Great Lakes part of the Midwest and is looking at 765 PJM as well. And they just came out with a new very much more ambitious plan than we've seen from them in the Mid-Atlantic and Urcott in Texas. Also have 765 KV plans. So that's four regions who are for the first time in many decades doing the highest AC voltage transmission lines that we have. So you know, they take time, but those are now being planned and there were also plans that started more like five, seven years ago, MISO long range transmission plan. Some of these are still facing some challenges like that one has. There's a challenge at FERC with some states, but hopefully that will go forward. California ISO has continued. They've been cranking along quietly for many years. Pretty much they're the only ones who have kind of gone nonstop on transmission. So every year they're doing more and it's bringing in resources from around the West. So yeah, I do think there's a lot of indications. New York has some. There's a new line that the NECEC and from Quebec into New England is finally going forward after some back and forth and tough court decisions and opposition. But I do think there are a bunch that are on their way and looking promising. So the curve may bend back up a little bit, at least. Like that stuff comes together. We could be building hundreds, thousands of miles per year? Yeah, we could be getting into a few thousand or more miles per year. And then how much is all this stuff tied up in the question of permitting reform? How much does that matter? Because it's not clear to me whether that's actually on the horizon, it may be, but it certainly hasn't happened yet. Do we need it? I do think we need it. I mean, you can build things here and there under the current regime, which again, you know, was proven by 10 years ago, we did it. But there are real limitations with that. And some of it is this big interregional opportunity. We don't really have a system in place to build interregional transmission from region to region, Myshod SPP or SPP to the interior west or interior west to the coast. All of these neighboring regions, there's a massive untapped value of transmission there. And we don't have a regional transmission organization with a planning process to deal with that. And this whole more, looking at the whole industry on a more macro scale, we're evolving out of an industry that started with 3,000 utilities doing their local thing and their local fiefdom without much of a tie between them. And so we're crafting onto the top this more regional and then interregional approach. And it's a process, a multi-decadal process that we're still working through and we're nowhere near the endgame on that. So we're still working through on that. Permitting reform, at least as set up in the Manchin-Barrasso Energy Permitting Reform Act, EPRA from a couple years ago, it has a transmission title. But it has a big focus on interregional transmission planning and determining what are the list of benefits that are the basis for cost allocation and some federal permitting role in there. So those things, in my opinion, are extremely helpful. It's a great bill. It was bipartisan past the Senate Energy Committee, 11 to 4, only one Republican opposed. One Senator Hawley who opposed the Greenbelt loan. But otherwise, very strong showing at the Senate Energy Committee. And now it's, I think it's teed up for the broader permitting package, which there are complexities on the other components of the package that both House and Senate are working through. I expect to see the House moving pretty quickly on one piece, the deeper related piece. And that'll be an important milestone. So I do think there's a chance and I do think it would have a very big impact on transmission and enabling transmission going forward. How much innovation do you see in the transmission world? In the sense of either planning, right? Like people talked about citing transmission lines along railways, that kind of thing. Undergrounding technology innovation. What do you think is interesting? Yeah, I do think there are some very interesting, I'll call them advanced, transmission. Transmission technologies, one category is high performance conductors with carbon core or superconductors where you put up a new wire either on the same tower or rebuild the towers. That's for re-conductoring more than new build, right? Yeah, that's right. It's for both. But yeah, but it does open up the opportunity for re-conductoring, which is very fast because you don't need a new right of way for that. So that's one category. Another category is grid enhancing technologies, which are more the operational type technologies, topology optimization, advanced power flow control, dynamic line rating, that sort of thing in storage as transmission you could put in there. And those increase headroom and capacity in a quick way. And again, the mantra in Washington anyway is speed to power because that's kind of the mantra for the data center community right now. And those things are speedy. They're relatively inexpensive and they're speedy. They don't fully solve the problem. It's not like you don't need new transmission as well. But they do increase the headroom and we all need headroom because it's a very constrained, congested grid right now. So final question, I guess. You mentioned we don't really have a system for interregional transmission. There are those out there, folks at Grid United, run by Mike Skelly, famous long time. Transmission developer, Invenergy and others who have planned projects that are interregional. So how are they doing it? Yeah, that's right. I mean, I think there is a little market for some transmission that you can cobble together enough, basically money from customers, like voluntary subscriptions from utilities along the route or at either end in order to pay for some lines. The long term, I don't think that's enough to build anywhere near the optimal amount. But there is some and these developers to their credit are looking at some super high value pathways and they have, I think in many cases, very cleverly figured out good routes that can be put together and worked things out with landowners. So many of them are pretty far along on that and what they do. I mean, they kind of pass the hat to utilities and say, hey, would you pay this much? And if they get enough, then they can go forward. And they do often need federal permits in one hopes that there are actual staff at the Department of Interior and places like that to actually issue permits. It does rely on that in many cases. But some of these lines are looking very, very promising. So I do think we will get some of those under the current regime, even if we don't get permitting reform. But if we get permitting reform and or significant FERC action in the interregional space, I think we would get a lot more. All right, Rob. Thanks for the update on the lines. We'll be back in another year and see if things have changed substantially from now. All right. We'll be ready for it. Good to talk to you, Cheryl.

    "description": "Across the country, people are asking the same question: why is it so hard to build in America?\n\nFrom transmission lines to clean energy factories, projects are taking longer, costs are rising, and frustration is growing. But in New Mexico, two cabinet secretaries are trying to show that it doesn\u2019t have to be this way.\n\nTogether, Economic Development Secretary Rob Black and Environment Secretary Jim Kenney are helping redefine how state agencies work with industry. Their model blends speed, access, and careful environmental oversight to help companies build more quickly without cutting corners.\n\nTogether, they\u2019re using that model to attract billion-dollar fusion and geothermal projects, expand water and infrastructure investments, and deploy the state\u2019s $65 billion sovereign wealth fund directly into advanced energy and deep-tech manufacturing.\n\nIn this episode, Stephen Lacey talks with Rob Black and Jim Kenney about how New Mexico is rewriting the rules of economic development, and what their partnership can teach the rest of America about how to make government work again.\n\nThis is a partner episode, produced in collaboration with the New Mexico Economic Development Department, which works to expand opportunity through innovation, infrastructure, and investment across the state.",
    "summary": "In this podcast transcript, Rob Black and Jim Kenny from New Mexico discuss their approach to making government work for the clean energy economy. They emphasize the importance of avoiding the traditional trade-off between economic growth and environmental protection. New Mexico's strategy involves providing white glove service, regulatory certainty, and quick permitting processes to attract clean energy projects. They highlight initiatives such as the state's sovereign wealth fund investing in deep tech and energy innovation, focusing on fusion, geothermal, and carbon capture technologies. By combining financial incentives, regulatory support, and research partnerships, New Mexico aims to become a hub for the fusion industry and drive economic growth while addressing climate challenges.",
    "transcript": " This is Partner Content from Latitude Studios. There's a lot of talk right now about how to build again in America. Powerlines, energy projects, transit systems, housing. It's expensive. It takes forever. And even when you have the money and the permits, something still seems to get in the way. And that's led to a bigger question. Did we just forget how to build things? That question is turned into a lively policy debate about how to make it easier and faster to get things done again. And so I turn to two people who are not debating it. They're living it. Rob Black, I am the Cabinet Secretary for the New Mexico Economic Development Department. My name is Jim Kenny and I am the Cabinet Secretary for the New Mexico Environment Department. Rob and Jim have a close partnership. Rob comes from business and utilities. Jim from the EPA. One of the things that's fun with Jim is he's an environmentalist who really wants to be an economic developer. And I'm an economic developer who's really an environmentalist. So it's created this kind of really interesting dynamic between the two of us. There's this old story in American politics that you can either protect the environment or grow the economy. One side builds things, the other side blocks them. And that tension has shaped decades of debate over energy, manufacturing, and growth. But in New Mexico, they don't really see it that way. Yeah, I think it's deconstructing that notion that you have to choose something, right? You have to choose between public health or environmental issues or economic prosperity. I think you're not working hard enough, especially in government if you think one of those has to win over the other of those. At the center of their approach is something they call white glove service. It's the government as concierge, fast, personal, and hands-on. If you need a permit, someone will walk you through it. If you're visiting the state, someone might literally meet you at the airport. My business card that I use every day has my mobile number on it. And I give that to folks because that's, I want to be that accessible. An example of Jim's white glove service, we had a company coming in, the energy company from Australia. He, the cabinet secretary, picked them up at the airport and drove them around. That's the level of engagement that New Mexico brings to the table. If people are looking for government to be a verb, then that's New Mexico. We are seeing across this country a lot of people asking how can we build better? How can we build more in America? And that it's getting harder to build things across America. Whether that's permitting challenges, local fights, political gridlock at many levels. When you look at that picture, why is New Mexico different? Rob? You know, we haven't been as partisan in a lot of those sort of conversations here in the state. It's about how do we actually deliver and improve people's lives? And being whether you're a Republican, whether you're a Democrat, whether you're from an urban area or a rural area, we all tend to lean in on how to do that. I think that is something that's culturally maybe unique to New Mexico, but it's allowed us to create unique structures like our Renewable Energy Transmission Act, which has helped us deploy transmission much faster than other areas of the country. We've put that kind of culture into policy, and I think that's why we're able to move faster. Is it that it's getting harder? Are people willing to get up from the table faster when they don't get their way? And I think there's a lack of sort of meaningful engagement and willing to solve problems. And I think what Rob is saying and what we're trying to show here out of the Environment Department is we won't be the first to get up from the table. We have to double down and work harder when the stakes are that much higher. So if we can't provide cheap and inexpensive and affordable energy to communities in New Mexico, then we have to sit at the table longer and work harder to find that solution. And that's what I think has sort of been a fleeting moment in America is that people are willing to get up from the table and not find solutions, right? And demonize each other as opposed to solve the problem. And that's not what happens at all here in New Mexico. In this episode, produced in collaboration with the New Mexico Economic Development Department, a conversation with Rob Black and Jim Kenny about how they're making government work for the clean energy economy. We'll talk about an approach that's helping attract billion dollar fusion projects, expand geothermal development and invest the state's $65 billion sovereign wealth fund directly into clean energy and deep tech. We're really focused on how do we get to yes and then what else can we do? You don't think of government as innovative, but I will say we've cracked the code on that here in New Mexico. When did you start really pursuing the clean energy market? And what's at stake if you don't continue to attract these companies? The path to this policy approach around renewable energy started as a state policy really with the Energy Transition Act, I believe in 2019. The governor led that as an effort to create a renewable portfolio standard, really set the stage to create a regulatory path for decarbonization of the electricity and energy sector. That was how we then said, here's now we're going to build around this and we're going to focus on areas both from an R&D perspective, but also deployment perspective where we're not only doing the research and development which New Mexico has done really well for a hundred years. I mean, when you look back to Sandia National Labs, Los Alamos National Labs, the things that we've built here, vision, fusion and fracking, we're all invented in New Mexico. How do we integrate that into a lower carbon energy economy and doing it in a way where we're doing the R&D here, but also then deploying the technology here? And so that, I think from a state government perspective, really started in 2019. Yeah, and I would add what's at stake. We're in a climate crisis. We need to continue to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. And that effort does, again, it doesn't have to be mutually exclusive from bringing those energy technologies to bear in New Mexico. You can reduce carbon emissions as well as diversify your energy portfolio. And here in New Mexico, diversifying away from those hydrocarbons, but not eliminating hydrocarbon production. But diversifying away from hydrocarbons while we continue to think about the ways in which energy will be deployed not only for your base load power, turning the lights on, your air conditioning, your heat, those essential necessities. But what about those users of heavy industrial applications where it's an intermittent power source, right? So we have to be able to power those peaker plants. We have to be able to power those electric arc furnaces. We have to be able to power anything that needs it on demand. So we really do need to be thinking about what other fuels can we bring into our portfolio and how do we still continue it to achieve the climate reductions as well as the localized air quality impacts that often come from combustion byproducts. And again, none of those things are mutually exclusive. Yeah. And as a result, you've been pretty diversified in your approach focused on everything from fusion to geothermal to carbon capture to hydrogen. How would you characterize this overall portfolio strategy? I think we're really trying to take a practical approach at decarbonization and understanding that you have to have energy intensity as well for certain types of manufacturing, other types of activity. That also means we've passed these strictest oil and gas regulatory regime really in the country, if not the world, here in New Mexico. So we've got the lowest carbon-intense barrel of oil and unit of natural gas anywhere. That was where we started because that's what the energy mix we had already. We're number two in oil production, number three in natural gas production in the United States. We have the only uranium enrichment plant in the United States today is in New Mexico. We have the most productive geothermal well now operating in the US, happening in New Mexico. So we're looking at what are those needs around firm load in particular? We've done great on wind. We do great on solar. But also, where can we invest R&D side on deployment side that's going to create that firm load that really creates the opportunity for reshoring, for whether it's data centers or other heavy users that allow us to grow our economy while ensuring we're meeting our climate goals as well. Everything that can be on the table that meets our legal requirements in terms of state law to reduce greenhouse gas emissions is on the table. So it's all the above within the context of our very clear climate and innovative approaches. Nationally, we're having this conversation about taking a strategic deregulatory approach to make it easier to build a wide variety of clean energy resources. How have you navigated regulation in New Mexico to both ensure the cleanliness of the oil and gas sector as much as possible, but also to make it easier to build and deploy a wide variety of resources? How have you navigated that in New Mexico? Yet, on the regulatory part, you're right. There's a big deregulatory agenda going on, and that's creating regulatory uncertainty. And if there's one thing that industry likes and we know that in government is that certainty is the most powerful thing that you can provide from a government standpoint. And when we look at that pendulum swinging between federal administrations pushing in either direction, here's New Mexico. We're going to be able to build a wide variety, certain, and moving forward to say that we are unwavering that we're going to pursue our climate goals. We're unwavering that we're going to collaborate with the oil and gas industry and other stakeholders to build out the most restrictive and pragmatic oil and gas regulations. So we've put all that into our state law, into our state rules, and we've insulated ourselves in New Mexico by having certainty through state law that's been in place now since the governor started in 2019. And we've just continued to chip away and build that certainty for the regulated industry or for industry in general. I think also the fact that we have what I would call as like sort of anti-backsliding measures, the things that we've codified into our state law gives industry certainty that administration to administration here at the state level, we're going to continue to have that certainty. So you know when you invest, the rug isn't going to be pulled out from under you in the next administration in New Mexico. I think those are really big points that we've been able to weather and promote here in New Mexico. The other thing we've done around this is focused on speed to market. And you know regulatory certainty is very important for business but also so is speed. So in the last legislative session, we passed several pieces of legislation that one that create a site readiness program where we're able to pre-deploy and certify a site as an economic development site, help put infrastructure in advance prior to a customer even being identified. And then if a utility comes to me and says, I think this site would be really good for economic development, I have 60 days to review that, certify it as an economic development site. And then if I do, it goes to the state public regulation commission and they will review that within six months to make a decision. So we've really tightened that timeline ability to deploy infrastructure quickly. We also passed a microgrid bill that allows users of over 20 megawatts, so I think large advanced manufacturing or hyperscalers to build microgrids very quickly in the state. And so we're really doing our best. They still have to meet the 2045 carbon emission standards, but we're really working on how do we help people deploy quickly so that we can be part of that economic development and that deployment of that next technology. And if I understand it correctly, New Mexico has the nation's second largest sovereign wealth fund. How big is that fund? And how is it directly investing in deep tech and energy innovation? Stephen, it's very exciting to talk about what the SIC, the state investment council is doing. So it's now about $65 billion in this fund. It is the second largest in the US, only behind Alaska. And we think we'll probably surpass Alaska in the next three years or so. What they've done is they've taken about $2 billion of that and put it into a venture fund that is working with the 25 to 30 largest deep tech venture funds in the world. Think groups like Lower Carbon, Antler, Coastal, up, and they're investing in those areas that align with the state's strategy. Our strategy, where we think we have the right to win in New Mexico is around advanced energy, computer, edge computing, space and defense. These are all areas because of the Sandia National Lab, Los Alamos National Lab, Air Force Research Lab, all located here, our universities. We have a unique competitive advantage. So now the state investment council is funding these funds who have portfolio companies who are aligned with that strategy. Think Pacific Fusion. Pacific Fusion has three different funds that are funded by the state investment council funding that company. And part of the direction of the state investment council is give us a return, but also deploy capital or create jobs in New Mexico. There are very few places in the world that have created this dynamic. And you're really thinking about Saudi Arabia, Abu Dhabi, Singapore, and now New Mexico, where you've paired a sovereign wealth fund with targeted investments aligned to a state strategy. So I think we're creating something that's very unique. It's also why XGS geothermal chose to build a 150 megawatt billion dollar geothermal plant in New Mexico because they were funded by a fund funded by the state investment council. So we're seeing incredible deal flow around deep technologies that we think will be part of changing the world. There's about 400 million dollars in monies available right now, simply around the water space. And one thing we know is that most energy sources have a degree of, they're a little thirsty on occasions. And so we need to bring water to that energy market so that we can continue our economic development. So what we've done is put about 400 million in sort of set aside dollars available in different pots of money. Maybe it's to bring brackish water to more usable water supply so it could go into like electrolyzers for hydrogen or maybe it could go into cement for wind turbines, right? Because why should we use fresh water from our communities if we could use brackish water or other lesser valued waters in terms of building out our energy and infrastructure environment? So it's not about just that direct certainty and speed to market. I think it's about those flanking pieces that bring capital that increase the ability to have a robust ecosystem around economic development. So you've got this capitalization strategy. How does that pair with tax credits, R&D tax credits, jobs credits, equipment credits, like how do you put this package together? That's a great question. And if you think about what happens with the state investment council, right, they're taking state dollars, putting them into company as equity investors. So now my job is to help that company be successful in New Mexico because that's going to give us a return to our investment. But it's also going to create jobs. It's going to create economic opportunity on the ground. So we have a research and development tax credit which can pay up to 10% on qualified research expenses. We have a high wage jobs tax credit that's refundable at 8.5% of your employees wages for four years. We're going to pay between 50% and 90% of your employees' wages for the first six months through New Mexico on new hires, depending on where you do it and the type of job. And then we have industrial revenue bonds which can waive property and equipment taxes for up to 30 years. We also will help build capital infrastructure with our local economic development program which could help you build a building, rent a building, or make improvements. So when you layer all of those things on with a capital stack, that means if you leave California, you don't leave Silicon Valley capital because we're going to make sure those folks are paying attention to you. It creates a really robust incentive structure. What we can do here at the Environment Department, if Rob comes to me as he's done in the past and says, we need water for this community or we need to think about treating the water from this industrial process. And what we at the Environment Department do, we also have a financing arm. And we can bring low interest loans and grants to municipalities who want to be in support of that economic development, but we can also bring it to the private sector. So I'm typically sitting on about $100 million or more in 0.01% interest monies for municipal governments in 2.375% interest rate for the private sector, 30-year fixed, beats any bond requirements typically. And we have that money available that we can stack. And I like the idea of this short stack of pancakes kind of forming here where we can bring that out as a financial package, not only through economic development, but through the Environment Department and our tax and rev department and sort of say, here's everything that we can do. Here's a financial strategy that supports your investment. So again, it's that whole of government coming together to solve a problem. I'm really interested to hear more about what is happening in fusion. You want to make New Mexico the center of the fusion industry. What does that vision look like through the end of the decade? And what kind of activity are you seeing right now? Well, we expect, we want New Mexico to be the center of fusion, if not for the U.S. for the world. You know, we're very pleased to announce that Pacific fusion was moving their R&D facility here. We're in conversations with a variety of other fusion companies. And again, this talk's a little bit about how we're doing it. So just a month ago, the State Investment Council created a new fund of over $300 million apart with lower carbon energy to fund fusion and advanced energy projects in New Mexico. So we're bringing that equity to the table. We've got San Diego National Labs and Los Alamos National Labs. So if you think about companies like Pacific Fusion who use magnet-based fusion technologies based off of the Z machine, which again was the first place to do kind of fusion here on Earth, that alignment and that proximity to work with those scientists is a big draw for New Mexico. Los Alamos National Labs, on the other hand, is really key to the laser-based fusion approach. So I think bringing those sort of aspects together gives us a very powerful, unique value proposition. You layer that on with access to capital and New Mexico becomes very attractive. Jim, how are you approaching fusion from the environment, department perspective? We license fusion facilities here in New Mexico out of the environment department and we have shown with Pacific Fusion and we're in the process of doing this is that we can be quicker, faster and just as protective as any other state in issuing the permit. It takes us about five to six months to maybe get one of those permits out the door and other states it's taking 18 to 24 months to get those permits out the door. Part of that is we've been very proficient in how we regulate those radioactive type based energy sources here in New Mexico. The second piece is we have such a deep and vast experience here in the environment department with radioactive type source material. Whether that's in X-ray machines or CAT scan machines, but we've also, being that we're the birthplace of the nuclear industry, we're still dealing with some of the adverse impacts of nuclear issues here in New Mexico. So we recognize that the past needs to be validated like we need to continue to work in the past and cleaning up those nuclear type issues that are still plaguing New Mexico. But we've built up such an expertise in our department around these topics and we understand the future is in cleaner energy like Pacific Fusion will be developing and we again can regulate those and get those safe licenses out the door faster than most other states. So again full service, full touch, recognizing the past but understanding that our clean energy future is going to be founded in these kinds of technologies. So we've talked about some of the building blocks. I want to hear more about what companies are looking for and I know it's really highly dependent on the type of company and industry we're talking about but are there any commonalities around what when companies are looking at a place to locate their facilities, their headquarters, build their businesses, what do they need and particularly in the clean energy industry? So they need access to power and they want green power. So again having a renewable portfolio standard means if you're locating a company here you're going to get that from in New Mexico. They need to be able to build and get to market quickly. So they want sites to be ready to go. And so that's why we've created a site readiness strategy where we're investing in advance even before a company shows up and making sure we've got industrial sites that can be quick to market less than a year to market as opposed to two or three years out. We mentioned regulatory certainty. That's really important. If you're a renewable energy company we've got a demand side for you as well, right? Because we need to help meeting our renewable portfolio standards. Our utilities do, our co-ops do. So you've got a place to deploy here as well. And then I'm going to make you the best tax deal you can in the country to manufacture your equipment. And I'm going to give you rail infrastructure that will get you to 75% of the United States population within two days. So we've got the logistics hub, we've got the tax structure for you, and we've got a market for you. And then we layer that with capital. I think there's a couple other pieces that we're hearing from companies. And I'm hearing specifically at the Environment Department from companies, many of the folks we're attracting to New Mexico are spending a significant amount of money on intellectual property. Whether that those are proprietary catalysts or their proprietary processes in the manufacturing and deployment of whatever it is, it could be electrons or it could be something else. And they want to understand that wherever they're setting up, that the state government understands the value of that IP coming to that location. And in one instance, a company said to me, they were being courted by many other states. And what they found in New Mexico was a deep rooted understanding that the intellectual property that they've spent millions and millions and millions of dollars on was going to be valued here in the state, not only by law and rule, but by the people that they're dealing with. In her and in that is we have two of the nation's top leading national laboratories here, Los Alamos National Labs and Sandia National Labs. So from state government to the laboratory setting, there's a lot of understanding about what that intellectual property means and how we can safeguard and protect it. And I think we've created that, again, that ecosystem where we're valuing the investment and we're valuing what people are bringing here and wanting to stand up to employ New Mexicans. And that's a great feeling. The other thing that businesses are really looking for is a workforce. And I think that's something that's really is unique in New Mexico. While we have the highest density of R&D spend in the US here in New Mexico, we also have the most PhDs per capita in the United States live here in New Mexico. But if you're going to do geothermal and you need to be able to drill holes really well, you won't find a better workforce for doing that than the Permian Basin. And that we share that with Texas here in New Mexico. And so you've got a great workforce for geothermal. We have the nuclear history here with the labs and your RENCO waste isolation pilot plant. We have people are trained in those technologies trained in nuclear cleanup and gyms shop and in the private sector. And so we have a really deep bench for workforce as well. That's something that employers really want. That brings me to another question. When we think about the availability of a skilled workforce, I mean, one of the challenges that you hear from manufacturers in the US is that it can be hard to find skilled workers or they can't afford to live in the place where they need to set up the manufacturing facility. And so it brings us to this bigger set of policies around childcare, college tuition, affordable living. How are you thinking about making New Mexico a more livable place to continue to keep the kind of skilled workers that you have in the state? It's something that we're very proud of. It's something that because of long-term investments in the state that helped build that sovereign wealth fund. That sovereign wealth fund not only invests in companies that are helping create jobs, it also pays for us as the only state in the country that provides free two and four year college tuition. For anybody who graduates from high school in New Mexico, you can go to free college in the state. As well, starting November 1st of this year, we will provide universal free childcare and early education programs for any family in New Mexico, only place in the United States. So we've taken this cradle to career approach of investing in our people and that's going to create the workforce. And frankly, those are benefits that if you're hiring people or you're bringing your people from California or New York to live in New Mexico, that's a benefit you as a company now are giving to your employees without having to pay for it because the state's going to pay for it for you. And so those are some of the things that we think we've created a really unique value proposition in New Mexico, coupled with the fact that it's one of the cheapest places to buy a home, own a home. We have some of the lowest electricity rates in the country while still having a strong renewable portfolio. It's a place that allows people to thrive and you can also get up on a ski slope very fast. So there's a lot of great beautiful things about the quality of life as well. So I'm hearing, I mean, there's so much thought and care that goes into this economic development strategy. What do you want to prove to the rest of the country? I mean, there are plenty of states where the cost of living is too high. Maybe infrastructure is overly politicized. There's a lot of local opposition, whatever it might be. What are you proving to the rest of the country in New Mexico? We can build the things we need to build. We can do it in a way that is equitable, that achieves our climate goals and our economic goals, that you can be a yes and environment. It doesn't have to be binary. It can be a lot of people can win. Yeah, and I'll add to that. When I render it down to answer your question, Stephen, I think it's just simply this. What we're proving in New Mexico is that we're both white-collar intellectual people, but blue-collar wrench-turners here, like we in government can think of the policies, get them codified, but we know how to implement. We are an action-oriented government who knows how to think, craft, and implement policy, and that translates into the results you just heard from Rob. Rob Black, his New Mexico's Secretary of Economic Development. Jim Kenney, his Secretary of New Mexico's Environment Department. This episode was produced in collaboration with the New Mexico Economic Development Department, which works to expand opportunity through innovation, infrastructure, and investment across the state.
