    "title": "The geopolitics of rare earth elements",
    "description": "China\u2019s new export controls on rare earth elements (REEs) are a problem for EVs, renewables, and other industries that rely on the minerals, especially the permanent magnets they\u2019re used in. The vast majority of the global supply chain is in China. Plus, Chinese companies control supply chain operations around the world.\u00a0  So is it possible to stand up a rare earth supply chain outside of China\u2019s control?  In this episode, Shayle talks to Ahmad Ghahreman, co-founder and CEO of REE recycler Cyclic Materials. (Energy Impact Partners, where Shayle is a partner, invests in Cyclic.) They cover topics like:   REE 101: the basket of 17 minerals, how they\u2019re mined and processed, and the most important five  Why an REE supply chain hasn\u2019t been built outside of China, even though the raw materials exist outside the country  The timeline of Chinese export controls leading up to the April escalation and what could come next  The specifics of what\u2019s limited, including oxides, alloys, and magnets  Why Ahmad is optimistic about building an ex-China supply chain  Other potential pathways, like recycling and designing more REEs-efficient products   Recommended resources:  The New York Times: The Mine Is American.

    "title": "What\u2019s next for the battery storage boom? [partner content]",
    "description": "The U.S. storage market is experiencing hockey-stick growth, with multiple gigawatts being installed quarterly. But new policy uncertainties around tariffs and the Inflation Reduction Act are threatening this momentum.  But Jeff Waters, the CEO of Powin, remains optimistic.  \"This industry will figure out a way to work with it,\" says Waters, who brings decades of experience from the semiconductor and solar industries. \"What we're doing is important.\"  Powin is a leading storage integrator that designs, commissions, and services some of the largest utility-scale batteries in the world. As Waters puts it, \"If you are a utility or if you are an IPP, if you want to integrate storage and own and operate a storage asset, we are that one throat to choke.\"  In this episode, produced in partnership with Powin, Stephen Lacey talks with Jeff about why he's still optimistic about the market despite significant headwinds. Drawing from his experience in semiconductors, Waters makes a case for how America should approach domestic battery manufacturing.  \"When I hear people talk about storage and say, 'We don't want Chinese companies investing or getting taxpayer money to build plants,' I think it's a ridiculous notion,\" Waters explains. \"The only way we're going to get anywhere in the U.S. market with storage is by partnering with the Chinese.\"  They discuss the extraordinary scaling of project sizes, the surge in electricity demand from data centers, technology trends beyond lithium-iron phosphate batteries, diverse deployment models, regional market opportunities, and the remarkable resilience of an industry used to navigating policy volatility.  This is a partner episode, brought to you by Powin. Powin is pushing the frontiers of energy storage.

    "description": "Big tech\u2019s data center construction boom is fueling a flurry of natural gas development, despite the fuel\u2019s challenges, and it\u2019s complicating big tech\u2019s climate goals. But carbon capture and storage (CCS) could mitigate emissions from those new plants, and hyperscalers could secure low-carbon power while meeting their needs for speed and reliability.\u00a0    So how could natural gas with CCS serve data center loads?    In this episode, Shayle talks to Julio Friedmann, chief scientist at Carbon Direct, who recently co-authored a couple pieces on the topic. Despite recent high profile cancellations of natural gas projects, Julio makes the case that gas-plus-CCS has attractive advantages, provided the carbon capture actually happens. Shayle and Julio cover topics like:       The surprisingly attractive economics, even at lower flue concentrations    Where it may compete with renewables, storage, and nuclear    The challenges of siting CO2 infrastructure and uncertainty around the 45Q tax credit    Whether \u201cCCS-ready\u201d kicks mitigation down the road, like H2 blending     Big tech companies like Meta that are signaling interest, but not taking action    The range of CCS technologies and the manufacturers jockeying to supply them    CCS\u2019s uncertain political future in the U.S.     Recommended resources:    Carbon Direct: Carbon Capture for Natural Gas-Fired Power Generation  Carbon Direct: Carbon capture for natural gas-fired power generation: An opportunity for hyperscalers  Latitude Media: Where does gas fit in the puzzle of powering AI?

    "description": "Premiums are rising. Insurers are leaving markets. But people keep building in risk-prone areas, and the climate disasters just keep coming.  Can insurance markets adapt?  In this episode, Shayle talks to Dr. Judd Boomhower, an assistant professor of economics at the University of California-San Diego and a faculty research fellow at the National Bureau of Economic Research. He studies how insurance markets are reacting to climate change. Shayle and Judd cover topics like:   Why insurers are limiting coverage in California, Florida, and other high-risk markets  How disaster insurance, unlike auto or health insurance, faces a flood of claims all at the same time  How catastrophe models (or \u201ccat models\u201d for short) work and why AI and other improvements struggle the solve the fundamental problem: a lack of historical data needed to predict future events  The challenges of private \u201cblack-box\u201d catastrophe models that can\u2019t be reviewed by third parties  Reinsurance markets and why they\u2019re not attracting more capital to shore up insurers  The pros and cons of parametric insurance, an emerging category of insurance products  Undercapitalized \u201cfly-by-night\u201d insurers that risk insolvency and failing to pay out claim   Recommended resources  NBER: How Are Insurance Markets Adapting to Climate Change?

    "title": "Frontier Forum: Future-proofing data center power infrastructure",
    "description": "Data centers face a critical timing problem. They need massive amounts of power immediately, but grid upgrades can take more than seven years to complete. Microgrids could be a solution to this growing power gap.  \"How do you future-proof your systems through adaptability of technologies? Microgrids are really a nice technology to address that,\" explains Adib Nasle, CEO of Xendee.  In this episode, recorded as part of a live Frontier Forum, Latitude Media's Stephen Lacey speaks with Xendee co-founders Adib Nasle and Michael Stadler about how microgrids can help data centers get power quickly, while also preparing for future technology changes.  The conversation explores how the combination of combined heat and power systems with supplemental technologies like batteries and renewables can create flexible, adaptable power solutions for mission-critical facilities. Their research across different energy markets shows striking cost reductions.  \"We saw cost reductions up to 80 percent in California and 60 percent in Virginia,\" notes Dr. Michael Stadler, CTO of Xendee. \"If you really go with the utility, it's always the most expensive case.\"  Using a stepped approach to microgrid implementation, data centers can achieve electricity prices significantly below grid rates \u2014 while maintaining complete control over their power infrastructure and preparing for future technologies like small modular reactors.  \"One way to think about microgrids is really as a Swiss army knife of energy infrastructure,\" says Nasle. \"You're getting localized resilience, economics, flexibility, scalability, efficiency through controls, and the inherent benefits of a decentralized system.\"  This is a partner episode, brought to you by Xendee. It was recorded live as part of Latitude Media's Frontier Forum series. Watch the full video to hear more details about microgrid design for data centers.",

    "description": "Everyone wants a piece of general purpose models. Instacart has deployed ChatGPT for recipes and meal planning. The Mayo Clinic is using it to summarize patient records. Schneider Electric is using an OpenAI LLM to generate sustainability reports.\u00a0  With such powerful models, what\u2019s the need for specialized models built for specific industries, especially in climate tech?  In this episode, Shayle talks to Sam Smith-Eppsteiner, partner at Innovation Endeavors. She recently wrote a blog post arguing that there may be a market that general purpose models struggle to meet: physical industries where training data is siloed, unstructured, and private. She talks through climate-relevant examples like Cadstrom\u2019s copilot for electrical engineers, Hubflow\u2019s automated trucker scheduling, WeaveBio\u2019s AI-powered platform for regulatory approvals. Shayle and Sam also cover topics like:   Applicable cases, like cross referencing complicated technical manuals, repetitive manual work that employees dislike, and technical compliance  The technical knowledge lost when workers retire and how specialized AI could help  What it takes to build specialized models, including data access, vector embedding, prompt engineering, and fine tuning\u00a0  What budget categories businesses might use to pay for specialized models  Selling the technology (i.e. the traditional SAAS model) vs selling the work (i.e. answers informed by models)   Recommended resources    Innovation Endeavors: Specialized brains for industry: the immense potential for domain-specific AI   Innovation Endeavors: The next industrial unicorn: Where is AI rapidly transforming the physical economy   Catalyst: The coming robotics wave   Latitude: How utilities are designing and embedding AI operating models   Credits: Hosted by Shayle Kann.
